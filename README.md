Jobs in Hajdú-Bihar megye

I am looking for a job for half a year now but couldn't find any. 
So i got curious about the opportunities in this state thats why i created this small program.
Data on this is not available, and I wanted my own for practice.
So a python scraper gets and saves the data from profession.hu into an excel sheet.

I took the excel sheet and put it into MySQL where I made some queries. Only a few outputs were used in the final process.
The visualization part was the most interesting for me because that is the type of job I'm looking for
        
        
        
This dashboard contains almost every diagram:

          We can see that this visualizations is mainly focused on the language and experience requirements.
          Readable that most open jobs are physical or skilled labor jobs.  and only a few IT jobs can be found.
          Also, the language requirements are low for most jobs.
          
 This is the most interesting diagram of all for me:

 The diagram above shows the jobs that require no experience at all.
 For a Junior like me with no experience, these are the only opportunities to get. 
 Sadly only 4 IT jobs are open with no experience required.


In the future, I want to expand this project to the whole country with more visualizations and Info about open jobs.
